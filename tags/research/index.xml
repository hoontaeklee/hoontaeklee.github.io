  I like the liberal atmosphere of academic community.

      <description>11 January, 2020 (Piao, GCB, Phenology) Piao S, Liu Q, Chen A, et al. Plant phenology and global climate change: Current progresses and challenges. Global Change Biology, 2019;00:1–19. https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.14619
Piao et al. (2019) reviewed the current understanding of leaf phenological processes. They suggested that four key factors are driving the phenological processes: 1) temperature, 2) photoperiod, 3) nutrient and water availability, and 4) interseasonal phenological correlations (i.e. the positive spring and autumn phenological intercorrelation).</description>

      <description>13 April, 2019 (Bonan, ANN, Climate) Bonan, G. B. (2016). Forests, climate, and public policy: A 500-year interdisciplinary odyssey. Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics, 47, 97–121.
I anticipated that this paper explains how the results from forest-climate research have been deployed to public policy. However, this paper had its focus to forest-climate relationships, and &amp;ldquo;these relationships should be understood well to be properly applied to policy&amp;rdquo; was all about the public policy.</description>
